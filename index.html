           <h3>Preliminary Research And Compilation On The Demiurge's Nature</h3>

        <b>
            In This Meeting We Hoped That We Could All Share Whatever Information We Each Individually Obtained On The Demiurge And
            Anything Relevant To The Demiurge. We Found, Predictably, That Few Had Any Information, And Even Fewer Had Useful 
            Information. Evidently We Will Need More Time To Do Much Research At Significant Cost In Order To Have Any Hope Of Avoiding
            This Alleged Cataclysm Or Even The Validity Of The Threat.
